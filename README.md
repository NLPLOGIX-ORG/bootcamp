# NLP Logix Summer Bootcamp
On the main branch, we intend to post collaborative work we will share across teams for instructional purposes. From here, we can branch into separate ones and have the students commit their own work.

## Anaconda
Anaconda Individual Edition is an open source distribution which includes all of the packages (jupyter, pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn) you will need for the bootcamp. 

First, install the Anaconda Navigator for Windows [here.](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

## Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter is a way to deploy python code to a web page along with markdown language and an integrated compiler. We would like to get you started on the Titanic dataset and the pandas library. 

Open Jupyter Notebook by following the steps [here.](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/#run-python-in-a-jupyter-notebook)
