# NLP Logix Summer Bootcamp
Throughout the next five weeks, we will be introducing some basic ideas of Data Science and Machine Learning as well as having you build your own machine learning models on given datasets. At the end of the camp, you will be demonstrating what you've learned by presenting your created models, results of the model, and how these results can be interpretated. We will be using the given software throughout the camp:

- Anaconda (Python Eviornment)
- VS Code (Programming Enviornment)
- Tableau (Data visualization Software)

## Schedule

**Week 1** - Introduction to Visualization

**Week 2** - Dashboard and Data Visualization

**Week 3** - Introduction to Python

**Week 4** - Build Machine Learning Models in Python

**Week 5** - Presentation Week

## Tableau
Tableau is a well known data visualization tool that can be used on a variety of different datasets. This will allow you to use the data in order to create
graphs, chart, maps, etc. in order to better visualize your data, and identify coorelations and trends.

Steps to install Tableau are included [here.](https://help.tableau.com/current/desktopdeploy/en-us/desktop_deploy_download_and_install.htm)

## Anaconda
Anaconda Individual Edition is an open source distribution which includes all of the packages (jupyter, pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn) you will need for the bootcamp. 

First, install the Anaconda Navigator for Windows [here.](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

## Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter is a way to deploy python code to a web page along with markdown language and an integrated compiler. We would like to get you started on the Titanic dataset and the pandas library. 

Open Jupyter Notebook by following the steps [here.](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/#run-python-in-a-jupyter-notebook)
