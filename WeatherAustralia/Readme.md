# Australia Rain
This dataset includes 10 years of weather records taken in different parts of Australia. With this, we will be building a model that depicts wether or not it will rain in Australia on a given day.

## Dataset
In our dataset, we have 3,478 rows of data with 23 columns for each different feature in our dataset. Below is a list outling exatly what each feature is which may play into how much it matters in the dataset.
